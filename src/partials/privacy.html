						*How APY works and what it means for you:</strong> As a T-Mobile MONEY customer you earn 4.00% annual percentage yield (APY) on balances up to and including $3,000 in your Checking account each calendar month when: 1) you are enrolled in a qualifying T-Mobile wireless plan; 2) you have registered for perks with your T-Mobile ID; and 3) you have deposited at least $200 in qualifying deposits to your Checking account within the current calendar month. Promotional deposits are not eligible toward the $200 in deposits. If you meet this deposit requirement in a given month we will pay you this benefit in the subsequent month as an added value provided all other requirements are met. This added value is subject to change. Balances above $3,000 in the Checking account earn 1.00% APY. The APY for this tier will range from 4.00% to 2.79% depending on the balance in the account (calculation based on a $5,000 average daily balance). Customers who do not qualify for the 4.00% APY will earn 1.00% APY on all Checking account balances for any month(s) in which they do not meet the requirements listed above. APYs are accurate as of 11/1/18, but may change at any time at our discretion. Fees may reduce earnings. For more information, see
